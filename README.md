### üìù Project Description:

In a work environment, Employee Attrition describes an unanticipated attrition of the workforce. The causes of this decline are all unavoidable reasons such as retirement, resignation, loss of work capacity, or sudden death. Companies with high workforce attrition rates often face the risk of abusing internal resources.

**Purpose:**

- Discover the factors that affect employee attrition and then take measures to reduce this rate.
- Build a machine learning model based on employee factors to predict whether that employee is likely to attrition or not?

---

### üìä Data Discovery:

- The dataset contains 1470 rows and 35 columns, with features like age, gender, education, job role, satisfaction levels, etc.
- There are no missing values or duplicate rows in the dataset.
- Some columns such as 'Over18', 'EmployeeNumber', 'EmployeeCount', 'StandardHours' have been removed as they do not affect the analysis results.

---

### üìà Discovering Relationships in Data:

- Explored relationships between various features and attrition using visualizations like count plots, pie charts, and box plots.
- Identified patterns such as higher attrition among younger employees, those who travel frequently, and those with lower job satisfaction.
- Analyzed relationships between features like age, income, gender, and attrition.
